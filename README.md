- 👋 Hi, I’m @ObjBr87 and I am a software engineering student, since august 2020.
- 👀 I’m interested in games of all kind.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity/C#, C and also about embedded systems in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .... I don't know the answer here.
- 📫 How to reach me I guess on here somehow?

I created a GitHub as a for two related reasons. First I wanted to explore new way to organize my code and make it a bit more persistent. 
Secondly I wanted to learn how to publish my code where others can see it and hopefully in the future use that to help market myself.

I'd love to collaborate or get inspiration on anything! I feel like there is so much I have learned that I don't know what to do with.
So if anyone has anything for me to do or ideas for me on what to do or just anything! Please, please, please!
